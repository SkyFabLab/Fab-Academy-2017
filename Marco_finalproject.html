			<h3>Final Project</h3>
  <div>
  <p>
  For the final project, I am having several ideas. An good approach would be something, we can use in the 
  lab and what reflects the spirit of <b><i>machines, that make machines</i></b>. I think a mill for cutting metal would be it. I will dicuss and 
  change a lot regarding this task as we proceed in the lectures. Nevertheless, this is a start. I see the potential for the KLab, to have such a toll and 
  the opportunity for me, to lear how to make such a piece. Especially I am interested in the programming and communication issues, which might appear.<br>
  To get this project going, there are several things, to think about in advance.

  <p>First is the time frame. I have 23 weeks to finish this. I want to have an aluminium bedding to have a proper way to fix the parts to mill. It has to have
  a sturdy structure, like the Ultimaker housing or amssive wood. To connet the wood, there could be joint fits helpful. I want to have some holding 'wings', 
  to be able to move the mill around and fix it with clamps in place. Therefore, there should be a way to level it, after movng it around.
