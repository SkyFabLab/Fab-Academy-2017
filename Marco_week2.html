<h2>
 <Week>Week 2 - Computer Aided Design</Week>
</h2>
<p>
The first week's assigment is to set up a webpage to track our progress in the academy.
We will use a version control tool, which is the free version of GitHub in my case.
  Starting with Git Hub. So, first things first…tutorial.
  Just set up a Git Hub account and starting working on it.

<p> Apparently it is not that difficult and now I need an editor…I'll give
  ATOM a try. I like the name and apparently it is from Git... Let’s try that.
  <br>
  <a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io</a>
  <br>
 Ok, I gave ATOM a try but I switched back to Notepad ++. I like this setup more and it's 
 easy to handle. I like the automatic closing tap, if you are opening one. 
 But if you like fancy shmancy setups, then stick with ATOM.

  Ok, after finding a proper editor, I need to edit. Seeting up the rough 
  sceme is not that problem rather that having it looking fancy. Therefore I work with 
  <b>C</b>ascading<b>S</b>tyle<b>S</b>heets.

  My first attempt has room for imrovement. I am looking for a fancy naviagtion bar with 
  drop down menu. As reference for HTML and CSS commands, I highly recommend 
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com</a><br>

<h4>Project Management software</h4>
<p>Another topic, I am dealing with, is a proper project management software. The first question, 
I need to answer is, if it is woth to spend time introducing myself to such a software comparing 
to the benefits, which is TIME, I am saving later.
There are several free programs available in the web. I am looking for a quick to learn, intuitive 
tool, whith a good documentation/tutorial culture. 
A basic feature is creating gant charts, which should be all 
of them capable of. Task juggle looks very powerful but not graphically deveoped, Openproj seems 
to have a more advanced visual developed surface. Trello is overpowered visual, looks like a
social network platform, rather than a working tool. Taiga has a nice webappearance and 
features the Kanban charts, which are highly visual and for me that means quick and it is 
connected to Github. I'll give that a try.
<br>
<a href="https://taiga.io/">https://taiga.io</a>
<br>
It is also browser-based, which is nice.</p>
After playing around, I ended up using Meistertask. 
<br>
<a href="https://www.meistertask.com/">https://www.meistertask.com</a>
<br>
It is free and you can create mindmaps, which 
I find useful.
