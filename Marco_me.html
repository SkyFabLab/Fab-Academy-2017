  Hi, my name is Marco Wehrfritz. I am a Physicist and I just moved from Germany
  to the Bay Area in California. I am the responsible Lab Technician for Fab Lab at
  the Skyline College.
  <br>
  This is the first Fab Lab in a Community College and we are just getting started!
  I am tinkering and prototyping all my life. As a kid, I made lots of model planes,
  during my vocational education, I built laser and as a student, I worked at a particle
  accelerator, where I build prototypes for detectors. After that, I was working as
  research associate in a consulting company for nuclear safety. After quitting my desk
  job and moving to the US, I used the opportunity to work in a Lab again. Teaching and
  Tinkering!
  <br>
  I donâ€™t know yet exactly, what I am going to build as my final project.
  My friend and colleague Nick Langhoff and I melting our brains and see what will be the outcome.
  First of all, I am very excited and curious, to learn about the possibilities of the Fab Lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am thinking, this page would be soemthing like a living document...of course!
  It will be improved and updated, as I proceed in the training.
