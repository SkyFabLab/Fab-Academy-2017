<p>
Hi, my name is Marco Wehrfritz. I am a Physicist and I just moved from Germany
to the Bay Area in California. I am the responsible Lab Technician for Fab Lab at
the Skyline College.

This is the first Fab Lab in a Community College and we are just getting started!
I am tinkering and prototyping all my life. As a kid, I made lots of model planes,
during my vocational education, I built laser and as a student, I worked at a particle
accelerator, where I build prototypes for detectors.
I don’t know yet exactly, what I am going to build as my final project.
My friend and colleague Nick Langhoff and I melting our brains and see what will be the outcome.
First of all, I am very excited and curious, to learn about the possibilities of the Fab Lab.
I am starting with finding an editor for my HTML.
</p>
<a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a>

<p>
  So, first things first…tutorial.
  Just set up a Git Hub account and starting working on it. First I need an editor…I think
  ATOM fit’s well. I like the name and apparently it is from Git... Let’s try that.
