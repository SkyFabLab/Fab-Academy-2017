Hi, my name is Marco Wehrfritz. I am a Physicist and I just moved from Germany
to the Bay Area in California. I am the responsible Lab Technician for Fab Lab at
the Skyline College.
<br>
This is the first Fab Lab in a Community College and we are just getting started!
I am tinkering and prototyping all my life. As a kid, I made lots of model planes,
during my vocational education, I built laser and as a student, I worked at a particle
accelerator, where I build prototypes for detectors. After that, I was working as
research associate in a consulting company for nuclear safety. After quitting my desk
job and moving to the US, I used the opportunity to work in a Lab again. Teaching and
Tinkering!
<br>
I don’t know yet exactly, what I am going to build as my final project.
My friend and colleague Nick Langhoff and I melting our brains and see what will be the outcome.
First of all, I am very excited and curious, to learn about the possibilities of the Fab Lab.
</p>
<p>
I am tjhinking, this page would be soemthing like a living document...of course!
It will be improved and updated, as I proceed in the training.

<p> Apparently it is not that difficult and now I need an editor…I think
  ATOM fit’s well. I like the name and apparently it is from Git... Let’s try that.
