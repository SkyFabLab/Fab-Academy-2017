  Hi, my name is Marco Wehrfritz. I am a Physicist and I just moved from Germany
  to the Bay Area in California. I am the responsible Lab Technician for Fab Lab at
  the Skyline College.
  <br>
  This is the first Fab Lab in a Community College and we are just getting started!
  I am tinkering and prototyping all my life. As a kid, I made lots of model planes,
  during my vocational education, I built laser and as a student, I worked at a particle
  accelerator, where I build prototypes for detectors. After that, I was working as
  research associate in a consulting company for nuclear safety. After quitting my desk
  job and moving to the US, I used the opportunity to work in a Lab again. Teaching and
  Tinkering!
  <br>
  I don’t know yet exactly, what I am going to build as my final project.
  My friend and colleague Nick Langhoff and I melting our brains and see what will be the outcome.
  First of all, I am very excited and curious, to learn about the possibilities of the Fab Lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am thinking, this page would be soemthing like a living document...of course!
  It will be improved and updated, as I proceed in the training.

<h2>
 <Week>Week 1 - Start a Webpage and thinking of a final projet</Week>
</h2>
<p>
The first week's assigment is to set up a webpage to track our progress in the academy.
We will use a version control tool, which is the free version of GitHub in my case.
  Starting with Git Hub. So, first things first…tutorial.
  Just set up a Git Hub account and starting working on it.

<br> <!-- a line break -->
<p> Apparently it is not that difficult and now I need an editor…I'll give
  ATOM a try. I like the name and apparently it is from Git... Let’s try that.
  <br>
  <a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io</a>
  <br>
 Ok, I gave ATOM a try but I switched back to Notepad ++. I like this setup more and it's 
 easy to handle. I like the automatic closing tap, if you are opening one. 
 But if you like fancy shmancy setups, then stick with ATOM.
  <bR>
  <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">https://notepad-plus-plus</a>
  <br>
  Ok, after finding a proper editor, I need to edit. Seeting up the rough 
  sceme is not that problem rather that having it looking fancy. Therefore I work with 
  <b>C</b>ascading<b>S</b>tyle<b>S</b>heets.

  My first attempt has room for imrovement. I am looking for a fancy naviagtion bar with 
  drop down menu. As reference for HTML and CSS commands, I highly recommend
