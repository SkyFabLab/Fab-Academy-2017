<h2>
 <Week>Week 1 - Start a Webpage and thinking of a final project</Week>
</h2>
<p>
The first week's assigment is to set up a webpage to track our progress in the academy and to write something short about myself.
<h4>Building a webpage</h4>
To build a webpage I need an editor…I'll give
  ATOM a try. I like the name and apparently it is from Git... Let’s try that.
  <br>
  <a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io</a>
  <br>
 Ok, I gave ATOM a try but I switched back to Notepad ++. I have used it before, so that's why I am biased. Nevertheless, I like this setup more and it's 
 easy to handle. Especiallty the automatic closing tap is convenient. 
 But if you like fancy setups, then stick with ATOM. I am sure, there are similar options.

  <br>
  Ok, after finding a proper editor, I need to edit. Setting up the rough 
  sceme is not that problem rather that having it looking fancy. Therefore I work with 
  <b>C</b>ascading<b>S</b>tyle<b>S</b>heets.
  <br>

  My first attempt has room for imrovement. I am looking for a fancy naviagtion bar with 
  drop down menu. As reference for HTML and CSS commands, I highly recommend 
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com</a> as a reference. 
  <br>
  The most time, I have spent to make the naviagtion menu bar and to put in the picture in the header. As I mentioned above, 
  putting content on the page is not as big as a challenge as making it look nice. Another source of how to set up a page is 
  <b>Ctrl + Shift + C</b> in your browser, which gives you the concole with HTML code of the actual page. Oh, how I miss a proper 
  spellchecker in Notepad++... :)<br>
  One thing to mention, is how to upload pictures. Since webspace is limited, you do not want to use it with large memory pictures. This also decreses the 
  speed with which your page is loaded in a browser. I have exported all my files to 
  </p>

  
 <h4>Version Control - GitHub</h4>
  
  
We will use a version control tool, which is the free version of GitHub in my case. I never used it but I see the benefit to keep track of all your changes.
  I am starting with Git Hub. There many tutorials, which make the life easier. First you creat an oline account and an repository. There you will safe all you 
  files and keep track of it. Next you clone your online repository to workl on your local machine with the editor of your choice.

<h4>Project Management software</h4>
<p>Another topic, I am dealing with, is a proper project management software. The first question, 
I need to answer is, if it is woth to spend time introducing myself to such a software comparing 
to the benefits, which is TIME, I am saving later.
There are several free programs available in the web. I am looking for a quick to learn, intuitive 
tool, whith a good documentation/tutorial culture. 
A basic feature is creating gant charts, which should be all 
of them capable of. Task juggle looks very powerful but not graphically deveoped, Openproj seems 
to have a more advanced visual developed surface. Trello is overpowered visual, looks like a
social network platform, rather than a working tool. Taiga has a nice webappearance and 
features the Kanban charts, which are highly visual and for me that means quick and it is 
connected to Github. I'll give that a try.
<br>
<a href="https://taiga.io/">https://taiga.io</a>
<br>
It is also browser-based, which is nice.
After playing around, I ended up using Meistertask. 
<br>

It is free and you can create mindmaps with Mindmaster which I find useful. There are no gant charts yet but we have just a week for each task, so it is pretty 
manageable.
